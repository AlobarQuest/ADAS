## Vision Summary

(Describe what this product is, who it serves, and the core problem it solves.)

Example placeholder:

> PROJECT_NAME is a web application that helps TARGET_USERS achieve PRIMARY_OUTCOME by providing MAIN_VALUE_PROPOSITION.

## Target Users / Personas

(List the main personas and a short description of each.)

- **Persona 1 – NAME**: short description, goals, and constraints.  
- **Persona 2 – NAME**: short description, goals, and constraints.  

---

## Domain Language

(List key domain terms and their precise definitions. These should be used in code, docs, and tests.)

- **Term 1 – NAME**: definition and how it appears in the UI / backend.  
- **Term 2 – NAME**: definition.  

---

## Goals & Non-Goals

- **Goals:**
  - G1: Core thing this product must achieve.
  - G2: Another important outcome.

- **Non-Goals:**
  - NG1: Things the product explicitly does *not* try to do.
  - NG2: Edge cases intentionally out of scope.

---

## AI Helper Guidance

- Use the domain terms exactly as defined here.
- When naming entities or functions, align them with this language.
- If a user request conflicts with the documented vision or non-goals, highlight the conflict and suggest aligned alternatives.
